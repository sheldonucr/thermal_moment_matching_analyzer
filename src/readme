'main.c' is the main function.It can be changed for different thermal model and different powertrace.

'tmm.c' is the core function to be called by main function, which will call two functions, named 'poleCompute.c' and 'residueCompute.c'.

'poleCompute.c' is to compute the system poles by Arnoldi iteration based model reduction.

'residueCompute.c' is to compute the residues with considering initial state and current input by pade approximation based moment matching.

'util.c' includes some utility routine, such as LU decomposition, Eigenvalue decomposition, and matrix operations.

'util.h' is the header file.

'Makefile' is used for compiling program. The default name is 'tmm'.

'p4northwood.mf' is the thermal model for P4 Northwood CPU, which is written in Matlab matrix form.


In order to run this program,
 typing "tmm -i  p4northwood.mf -q 5", which means that we perform the analysis
using the input file p4northwood.mf with reduction order 5.
